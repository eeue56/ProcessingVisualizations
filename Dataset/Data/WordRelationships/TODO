Future things to inspect for word relationships:

    1) It should be possible, given a large enough training set, to work out whether or
        not a word is sensible in the given context. For example, if we had a dataset with the sentences
            ''' Hello fishfrog, the cat sat on the mat.
                Today is Thursday, I sat down on the dog yesterday. '''
        then if given the sentence
            ''' Hello dog Thursday, I sat on the mat.'''
        it could tell us that dog or Thursday can't be there.

    2) The current system handles things like quotes rather badly. This needs fixing - perhaps adding a subclass of Word
        as QuotedWord or something similar, that would handle the sentence as sentences are currently handled, but replace
        start/end word syntax with matching "(', etc.

    3) There needs to be a better way to show all these relationships. Printing a sentence at a time is interesting,
        but it's not very useful.
